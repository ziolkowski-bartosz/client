## General Information

- As an avid cook and enthusiast of Polish cuisine, I've collected several pictures of dishes, including many traditional Polish recipes, in my photo gallery. Combined with my love for Copenhagen, I decided to turn this into a web application, which resulted in the project you see here.

- The Polish community is the second-largest national minority in Denmark, and while there is a shop in Copenhagen selling Polish products that is doing very well, **there is no restaurant serving Polish food**. Given the potential target audience, opening and running such a restaurant sounds like a sensible business idea.

- The aim of the project is to provide a web application concept for a restaurant serving Polish cuisine in Copenhagen.

- The web application would be presented to anyone interested in opening such a restaurant and can serve as a real, ready-made product or as an inspiration for an actual one.
