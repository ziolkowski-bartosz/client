# PolenixDK - web application for food ordering

## Overview
As an avid cook and enthusiast of Polish cuisine, I've collected several pictures of dishes, including many traditional Polish recipes, in my photo gallery. Combined with my love for Copenhagen, I decided to turn this into a web application, which resulted in the project you see here. The aim of the project is to provide a web application concept for a restaurant serving Polish cuisine in Copenhagen.

In this application, users can create an account and place orders for selected items from the menu. For this project, I utilized React in combination with Node.js and a relational database, MySQL. Additionally, user authentication is handled using JWT (JSON Web Tokens), which provides a secure method for verifying users and managing sessions. This setup demonstrates my proficiency in building full-stack applications, implementing authentication mechanisms, and working with modern technologies for both frontend and backend development.
